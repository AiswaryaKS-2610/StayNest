# 🇮🇪 StayNest — Full Project Overview

## What StayNest Is

**StayNest** is a cross-platform (Android + iOS) rental accommodation app built with **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**, packaged using **Apache Cordova** to deliver a native-like mobile experience. It is designed specifically for the **Irish rental ecosystem** and focuses heavily on **student renters** and **international users** moving to Ireland.

The app is built around three roles:

* **Tenant / Student**: Finds accommodation, filters, views on map, saves, contacts brokers, and requests visits.
* **Broker / Property Owner**: Lists and manages properties, handles enquiries, uploads verification documents.
* **Admin**: Verifies brokers, approves listings, moderates content, enforces trust and safety.

The key “product promise”:

> **Find your home in Ireland — safely & simply.**
> Meaning: transparent prices, verified brokers, map-based discovery, and student-first tools.

---

## Core Goals

### 1) Ireland-first localization

StayNest is not a generic rental app. It includes:

* Irish **Eircode** search
* Irish city and university quick-search (Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, etc.)
* **RTB registration indicator** (where available/declared)
* Transport awareness for Irish commuters (**LUAS/DART/Bus**)
* Student-relevant details (bills, heating, lease length, distance to campus)

### 2) Trust-first verification model

Scams are a major worry for students and people abroad. StayNest solves this by:

* **Role-based signup**
* **Broker verification enforced by admin**
* **Listing approval required before publishing**
* Trust badges and “Verified Broker” identity signals across the UI

### 3) Map-based discovery + student-friendly filters

The discovery experience is built around:

* **Map + list hybrid**
* Filters that update what is visible on the map and list
* “Near my campus” quick access + radius search
* Student essentials like: **bills included, heating type, lease flexibility**

---

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

* **HTML5 + Vanilla CSS + Vanilla JS (ES6+)**
* Design system driven by CSS variables (your **green + white** theme)
* Mobile-first layout with smooth animations and card-based UI

### Mobile Wrapper

* **Apache Cordova**
* Enables native device access later (geolocation, camera upload, push notifications)

### Backend

Planned with **Firebase**:

* **Firebase Authentication**: email login (and later Google/Phone)
* **Firestore**: property listings, profiles, chats, approvals
* **Cloud Storage**: listing images, broker ID documents
* **Cloud Functions** (optional future): notifications, moderation triggers, payment hooks

---

## Full Role-Based User Journey

## 👤 A) Tenant / Student Journey (End-to-end)

### 1) Splash & Entry

User opens app:

* Premium splash screen (logo + Ireland message)
* Entry choice: **Login as Tenant/Student** or **Login as Broker**

Why this matters:

* Immediately clarifies the app’s multi-role design (examiner-friendly)
* Prevents mixing broker tools with tenant screens

### 2) Authentication

Tenant logs in with:

* Email + password (simple)
  Later extension:
* Google sign-in, phone OTP (especially useful for international users)

### 3) Tenant Dashboard (Explore)

The tenant lands on a clean discovery dashboard that includes:

* Search bar: “Search by City, Eircode, or College…”
* University quick chips: Trinity, UCD, DCU, UCC, ATU, etc.
* Service shortcuts (optional): movers, cleaning, legal support
* Listings grid/cards

**Tenant-friendly listing cards show:**

* Price/month
* Location area
* Key icons: bills included, furnished, wifi, etc.
* “Verified Broker” badge

### 4) Map Search (Core Feature)

Tenant can switch to map mode or a hybrid view:

* Pins show prices (e.g., €900)
* Clusters show grouped listings
* Only listings matching filters appear

**Map features:**

* “Near My Campus”: select a university → show within radius (5km / 10km)
* Tap marker → preview card pops up
* “Open details” from preview

### 5) Filters (Student-first)

Tenant uses filters designed for Ireland + students:

**Price & affordability**

* Budget slider
* Deposit indicator (if available)

**Student essentials**

* Bills included
* Wi-Fi
* Heating type (important in Ireland)
* Furnished vs unfurnished
* Lease length (3/6/9 months)
* Ensuite / studio / shared room

**Rules & lifestyle**

* Guests allowed
* Quiet hours
* Pet-friendly

**Compliance (trust)**

* RTB-registered tag (if provided)
* Verified broker only toggle (optional)

### 6) Property Details Page

This page is designed to answer: “Can I trust this? Can I afford this? Can I live here as a student?”

**Sections**

* Image gallery + video/virtual tour indicator
* Price breakdown:

  * rent
  * deposit
  * estimated utilities (optional)
  * hidden fee flags (if any)
* Amenities grid
* Location block:

  * mini map
  * distance to campus
  * nearest transport
* Broker card:

  * broker name
  * badge (verified/unverified)
  * rating (if reviews enabled)
  * “Message broker” / “Request visit”

### 7) Request Visit / Enquiry

Tenant can:

* Send a message enquiry
* Request a viewing time
* Save the property for later

### 8) Saved / Wishlist

Students often compare multiple places and discuss with parents/friends. So saved listings should include:

* Folders (e.g., “Near Trinity”, “Budget Options”)
* Compare mode (optional)
* Notes (optional): “Ask about bills”

### 9) Chat (Tenant ↔ Broker)

Chat is real-time (Firebase later). Must include:

* Broker badge visible at top
* Safety message: “Do not pay outside the app”
* Attachments (optional later): documents, tenancy forms

---

## 🏢 B) Broker Journey (End-to-end)

### 1) Broker Role Selection + Signup

Broker chooses “Login as Broker”.

**Key difference**: Broker accounts do not instantly gain power.

### 2) Broker Verification (Critical)

Broker must upload documents:

* Government ID (Passport/IRP)
* Proof of address or business documentation

Status system:

* **Unverified** → can browse broker dashboard but cannot post listings
* **Pending review** → waiting admin decision
* **Verified** → can submit listings for approval

This is the main trust engine of StayNest.

### 3) Broker Dashboard

Brokers see:

* Listings count
* Views & enquiries
* Listing status breakdown:

  * Draft
  * Pending approval
  * Approved
  * Rejected (with admin note)

### 4) Listing Management (CRUD)

Brokers can:

* Create listing (form steps)
* Upload multiple images
* Edit listing
* Mark as rented/unavailable

**Listing fields designed for Ireland & students**

* Eircode
* Rent per month
* Deposit
* Bills included checkbox + details
* Heating type
* Lease length options
* House rules
* RTB status (if registered)

### 5) Approval flow (double moderation)

Even verified brokers must submit listing for approval:

* Broker submits
* Admin approves/rejects with notes
* Only approved listings appear to tenants

---

## 🛡️ C) Admin Journey (End-to-end)

The admin role exists to ensure:

* identity trust
* scam prevention
* content quality
* platform compliance

### 1) Admin Dashboard

Admin sees queues:

* Broker verification requests
* Listing approvals pending
* Reported content

### 2) Broker Verification Screen

Admin reviews:

* broker profile
* uploaded documents
* verification history

Admin actions:

* Approve broker
* Reject broker (with reason)
* Suspend broker (if suspicious)

### 3) Listing Approval Screen

Admin reviews listing for:

* location accuracy
* images quality
* scam patterns (unrealistic prices, duplicate photos)
* missing fields

Admin actions:

* Approve
* Reject with notes
* Flag for manual investigation

### 4) Moderation & Reports

Tenants can report listings. Admin can:

* remove listing
* warn broker
* suspend account
* log actions (audit trail)

---

## Ireland-Specific Details You Should Emphasize (Examiner Gold)

### Eircode Search

* Properties are indexed by Eircode
* Search accepts Eircode input and matches instantly

### University-first browsing

* Most renters are students → campus-based flow is more natural than “city only”

### Heating type + bills clarity

Ireland rentals often vary heavily in heating cost. So the UI clearly shows:

* Gas vs electric vs central heating
* Bills included or not
* estimated cost (optional later)

### Trust model for international students

International students cannot physically inspect property easily. So StayNest adds:

* Verified broker badges
* admin approval before listings go live
* virtual tour requirement (optional policy)
* clear “report” option

---

## What Each Major Page Represents (System-Level Understanding)

* **Splash / Entry**: brand + trust + role clarity
* **Tenant dashboard**: discovery hub
* **Map view**: location and commute decisions
* **Filters**: reduce time wasted + match student constraints
* **Details page**: confidence building + transparency
* **Chat**: conversion point (enquiry → viewing)
* **Broker dashboard**: listing lifecycle and reputation
* **Admin dashboard**: platform integrity and scam prevention

---

## Suggested Data Model (Firestore-friendly)

You don’t need to implement all now, but describing it in your report makes you look very professional.

### Collections

**users**

* id, role (tenant/broker/admin), name, email
* brokerStatus: unverified/pending/verified/suspended
* verificationDocs (storage links, timestamps)

**properties**

* title, type, price, deposit, billsIncluded
* location: county/city/eircode/lat/lng
* nearUniversity tags
* amenities array
* rules object
* status: draft/pending/approved/rejected/rented
* brokerId reference
* adminReviewNotes

**chats**

* tenantId, brokerId, propertyId
* lastMessage, timestamps

**reports**

* reporterId, propertyId, reason, status, adminAction

---

## Security & Permission Rules (Important)

Even in a student project, describing this clearly gives huge credibility.

* Tenants can read approved listings only
* Brokers can write listings only if verified
* Brokers can edit only their own listings
* Admin can approve/reject and update statuses
* Verification documents are private (admin only)

---

## What Makes StayNest “Different”

1. **Built for Ireland**, not generic
2. **Student-first filters** that match real student needs
3. **Admin-gated verification** to fight scams
4. **Map + campus distance** as the main discovery method
5. Designed for **international renters** who need extra clarity

## If You Want, I Can Turn This Into a Full Report Format

If you’re submitting this to college, I can rewrite this as a formal document with:

* Abstract
* Problem statement
* Objectives
* Methodology
* System design
* Features
* Testing plan
* Future work
* Conclusion

Just tell me your submission style (report / slides / viva script) and I’ll format it exactly.
Perfect choice 👍
Separating **frontend (client)** and **backend (server)** is a **very strong architectural decision**, especially for a project review. Below is a **clean, industry-style structure** adapted for:

* **React.js (Frontend / Client)**
* **Node.js + Express (Backend / Server)**
* **Apache Cordova (Mobile wrapper)**

I’ll explain:

1. Overall architecture
2. Final folder structure
3. What changes from your current setup
4. What each folder/file is responsible for

No code — **concept + structure only**, exactly what reviewers expect.

# 🏗️ Overall Architecture (High Level)

```
StayNest
│
├── client/        → Frontend (React UI)
├── server/        → Backend (Node + Express API)
├── cordova/       → Mobile wrapper (Android/iOS)
└── README.md
```

### How they talk to each other

* **Client (React)** → calls → **Server (Express APIs)**
* **Server** → handles auth, data, verification logic
* **Cordova** → wraps the built React build into a mobile app

This is **real-world production architecture**.

## 🧠 What CLIENT is responsible for

* UI & UX only
* Routing (Tenant/Broker/Admin screens)
* Form validation
* Calling backend APIs
* Showing states:

  * Unverified broker
  * Pending approval
  * Approved listing
* No business logic about permissions (backend decides)

---

## 🧠 What SERVER is responsible for

* Authentication (login/register)
* Role enforcement (tenant / broker / admin)
* Broker verification logic
* Listing approval workflow
* Data validation
* Security
* API responses
* File uploads (ID documents, images)

---

# 📱 CORDOVA (Mobile Wrapper)

```
cordova/
├── config.xml
├── hooks/
├── platforms/
│   ├── android/
│   └── ios/
├── plugins/
└── www/
    └── index.html   ← React build output goes here
```

### How Cordova fits in

* You **build React**
* Copy build files into `cordova/www`
* Cordova wraps it as Android/iOS app

This keeps **React clean** and **Cordova isolated**.

---

# 🔁 What Changes From Your Current Setup

### ❌ Old (Mixed)

```
www/
├── index.html
├── css/
├── js/
```

### ✅ New (Professional)

* No UI logic in Cordova
* React handles UI
* Express handles logic
* Cordova only wraps output

---

# 🔐 Role-Based Control (Where It Lives)

| Responsibility             | Client | Server |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Show UI                    | ✅      | ❌      |
| Validate forms             | ✅      | ✅      |
| Decide broker verification | ❌      | ✅      |
| Approve listings           | ❌      | ✅      |
| Enforce roles              | ❌      | ✅      |
| Trust rules                | ❌      | ✅      |

This separation is **VERY important for grading**.

---

# 🧠 How You Explain This in Review / Viva

You can say:

> “I separated the frontend and backend to follow industry best practices.
> The React client handles UI and user interaction, while the Node.js + Express server manages authentication, role-based access control, broker verification, and listing approval.
> Apache Cordova is used only as a wrapper to convert the React web app into a native mobile application.”

That sentence alone = **excellent marks**.

---

## If you want next:

* Day 3–4 plan updated for React + Express
* API design table (endpoints only, no code)
* ER diagram explanation (users, brokers, listings, approvals)
* How to deploy client + server separately

Just tell me 👍
